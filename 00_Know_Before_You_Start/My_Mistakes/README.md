# Some mistakes which I committed. Hope you will get to learn from it.
<br><br>

<h2> 1. Focusing too much on the programming language</h2>
<p>
<b>One of the basic mistakes that i committed made is investing too much time in deciding the programming language they should use for competitive 
programming. There are lots and lots of articles about why CPP is better than Java (or vice versa) for competitive programming, the number of libraries 
Python has, how fast CPP is, and so on. But it does not mean, if you choose Java, you cannot outperform a coder in CPP/Python. There are top competitive programmers who use Java, CPP,  Python, and other languages as well. In the end, what matters is how effective you are in implementing your logic in any programming language. As long as you are able to do that, any programming language could be the best one for you.</b>
</p>
<br><br>
<h3> 2. All practicing, No learning</h3>
<p>
<b>When i started competitive, solving more and more problems was my first target. I solved 100-150 problems in a month, after which, i too lack in confidence. I practiced this until i got a realise you are bound to get stuck at some point, until and unless you learn related topics concerned with the problem. For instance, if there is a question that requires lazy propagation of a segment tree, no matter how well you know a normal segment tree, you cannot implement it. It is important to keep learning new algorithms, data structures. Becoming better in competitive programming is not all about solving problems. In the long run, when you have knowledge of a sufficient number of data structures and algorithms, you will be able to find the logic of most of the questions just by reading them.</b>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>3. All learning, No practice</h2>
<p>
<b>The other wrong way that I myself committed is going in learning data structures and algorithms through blogs, or posts, certain coding platforms like codeforces, 
cp-algorithms, youtube tutorials, and seeing solutions of the problems which i was not able to solve , just after the contest. Always looking for resources to learn new algorithms but being lazy enough to implement and practice the same.Sometimes not even coding the data structures themselves thinking it's too complicated and that it would be best to just copy-paste it from the resource available online whenever required.I did the copy-paste part until I had to implement it from scratch in a live contest. So, knowledge of a topic is of little value unless you can code it during a live contest or an interview. Most importantly, you have to know when and where you have to apply it. For instance, fast modulo exponentiation, modulo inverse, finding GCD using Euclid's Algorithm is one of the first algorithms i read but I failed to implement it in live contest until i practiced it from scratch.</b>
</p> 
<br><br>
<h3>4. Only participating in contests</h3>
<p>
<b>One of the best things about competitive programming is that it provides a significant number of opportunities to showcase your skills.I jumped to contest after getting somelevel of coding and once i scored good results, i stopped practicing. Soon my attitude began just to pratice in live contests. this limited my learning to contests only. This is an most incorrect way to carry on competitive coding unless you are happy with the stagnant results.</b>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2> 5. Not participating in contests</h2>
<p>
<b>If you keep practicing and never actually participate in a contest, there is no way you can evaluate your performance. Contests help us understand 
our position in the real world. They help us evaluate our hard work by competing with others in the same field. Solving a question during a contest is a lot different than solving it in free time. Being time-constrained while withstanding the pressure by the competition from the fellow participants actually shows how effective you are.It helps you to judge yourself on actual parameters like knowledge, time, speed, problem-solving and debugging skills , modularity of code. It boosts the programmer to write cleaner and better code.</b>   .

<h2> 6. Solving random questions</h2>
<p>
<b>At start of competitive journey  i started solving random questions. for e.g : 
Codeforces - A, B type regularly,
Codechef, hackerrank - cakewalk, easy, medium etc.
Solve random questions wont benefit me at all. Unless you have a plan to understand problems in one category, the improvement will not be significant. It's true that in competitive programming success resides in knowing different algorithms and being able to solve the diverse sets of questions. Initially, the goal shouldn't be to improve ranks, In fact, the focus should be on learning new topics and being able to solve questions pertaining to those topics.</b>
</p>

<h2>7. "Giving up" or Loosing hope very soon</h2> 
<p>
<b>"Merepe nhi hopayegaa "
"mere bas ki baat nhi "
"It's too difficult to solve "
"It's too frustating, I can't handle it "
Well, I made all of these excuses and mistakes.
Yes, it can get frustrating at times. I have been in situations where I spent a number of hours trying to solve a question without reaching an optimal 
solution. There will always be questions that you might not be able to solve. It does not mean that you should just give up. It does not equate to failure. 
In any case, you will learn a new concept thereby progressing in your CP journey. A general suggestion would be to always look at the editorials to learn new concepts and to understand why you were unable to solve the problem.</b>

I have modified it for mistakes which i committed.

Thank you<br>
